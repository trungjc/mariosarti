<p><strong>Working with items</strong></p>

<p>Each item in your menu has its own entry here, and you have a lot of flexibility in how they display. You can update the name and description of each item, and set the price. Note that if you want a currency symbol ($, etc.) to show up with the price, you will need to enter it. If you have images of each item, extended version users can upload those, too, and they'll display on your site. Use the drop-down menu to assign the item to a category. <em>Important: Each item must be assigned to a category to display on your page. See "Working with categories" for information on choosing to not display category names and descriptions</em>. If you do not want this item to display on your site, untick the checkbox labeled "Active." You can also choose to not display the price by unticking this checkbox. If you want to specify the order in which the items display within the category, you can set the order by entering weighted numbers in the "Display Order" box. You can also add our icons for things like "spicy" and "specialty" to an item, or purchase the extended version and add your own.</p>
