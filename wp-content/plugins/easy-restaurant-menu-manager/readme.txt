== Description ==

Tired of using PDFs to post your restaurant's menus online? Easy Restaurant Menu Manager makes it simple to add and update all your dishes in a way that's easy for your site's visitors to read and easy for you to maintain. You can add categories like appetizers, entrees or desserts -- name them whatever you want -- and set the order those categories should display in. Include a description for each item, and decide whether or not you want to display the price. Want to tweak the display? Add CSS right from the plugin, without fiddling with theme files. This plugin isn't just for restaurants. Spas, service stations and others can use it to share their menu of services.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the plugin and upload it to your site’s wp-content/plugins folder.
2. Activate Easy Restaurant Menu Manager through the “plugins” area in your WordPress dashboard.
3. A new menu item called "Manage Menus" will appear in your dashboard navigation. You can go there to start creating menus, categories and items.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What will the menu look like on my site? =
The Easy Restaurant Menu Manager plugin is designed to work with your WordPress site's theme, using your fonts and colors to seamlessly fit in with the rest of your site. If you want to tweak how the menu displays, you can enter custom CSS into the plugin from the settings panel.

= Can I include images of menu items? =
The free version doesn't include an option to upload photos, but that feature is available in the extended version.

= What size should my image be? =
It's best to not upload giant versions of your photos, since they are being downsized to 100px wide on the menu. A width of around 600px is a good target, since the file size won't be unmanageable and visitors can still get a good look at the item when they click on the thumbnail.

= How are menu items organized? =
You probably have your menu organized into categories like appetizers, entrees and desserts on your printed menu, and you can do the same thing with this plugin. You can even add extra text that will display below the category name, such as note explaining that all entrees come with two sides.

= Is there a way to note if an item is special, like it's new or spicy? =
Not in the free version, but in the extended version, you can use icons to show that items are new, spicy, vegetarian, healthy or house specialities. Extended version users can also add their own icons!

= Can I hide items or categories, such as seasonal items, without deleting them? =
Yes! You can deactivate items and categories so you don't want to show. This allows you to remove an item from your menu without losing all the information you've added. 

= How many menus can I create? =
Using the free version, you can create one menu only. However, with the extended version, you can create unlimited menus.

= How do I insert my menu into a page or post? =
Just use the shortcode [WP_Restaurant_Menu id="{DB id}"], the id and entire shortcode is made available on the menu edit screen on the WordPress backend.

= What about printing the menu? =
We know many restaurants want to provide a version of their menu that customers can print and keep on hand. With the Easy Restaurant Menu Manager plugin, you can choose to include a "Print this menu" link that will generate a printer-friendly version of your menu.
